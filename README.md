# Vulkan-Tutorial-C
A C port of [https://vulkan-tutorial.com/](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).

This tutorial has been written to closely match the original, it uses the [tinyobjloader-c](https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader-c) library by Syoyo and the [single-file public domain](https://github.com/nothings/stb) library by Nothings.

This has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04.1 with GCC and Clang, and on Windows with Visual Studio 2019.
